# retropie-python-tools
Create Philips_CD-I gamelist.xml for Retropie from cdi.xml of lr-mame/lr-mess.

When you use lr-mess for running Philips_CD-I you make use of shortnamed link files.
This script converts the "good info" of cdi.xml from lr-mame/lr-mess to a useful retropie gamelist.xml.

For now, only the "shortnames with path" and the "longname-discription" are converted. 

You can read the script to find out more.
